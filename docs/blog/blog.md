I decided to get started on work and research regarding my project this week. This would involve initial drafting of my project proposal and researching the various technologies I want to use in my solution. Primarily the research will focus on Hyperledger and the implementations of it currently available. As It's open-source, there will be a lot of varied documentation on it but I'm confident in what's currently there from what I have previously found. My main source of information will come from [their own documentation pages](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

I took the opportunity to meet with two lecturers I thought would help me with my project. Brian Stone was my project supervisor for my third year project. He was extremely helpful last year so I wanted to get his input into my current idea. Geoff Hamilton was my other choice for the project supervisor. He has a background in the field I'm looking at so his experience would be very useful in avoiding some of the common pitfalls.
Over the past few days I have been putting together my project proposal and I intend to send on drafts to both of them and get some feedback.

After some discussion and emails with Geoff Hamilton he has agreed to be my project mentor. I think he'll be very helpful as he has a background in cryptography and security. As my project focuses on this, the help will be invaluable. I finalised everything I wanted in my [project proposal](https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/mcneilc2/2018-ca400-mcneilc2/blob/master/docs/Proposal/Project%20Proposal.pdf). I'll email on the final draft to Geoff and get his thoughts before pushing it to git.

Due to the weather my project proposal was pushed forward a week. Today the meeting went ahead and there were no issues. The meeting was with Charlie Daly and Donal Fitzpatrick. They liked my idea and didn't see anything wrong with the approach I'm taking. They reiterated the importance of security in the project and how I'm going to be handling the personal data being used. I've always kept this at the forefront of my planning so I don't see any issues stemming from this. My next steps will be to start on the preliminary version of the functional spec and see what Geoff thinks. If he gives the go ahead I will push it to the repo.

I've finished writing the proposal and have received back Geoff's thoughts on it. He didn't see any major issues and he thought it was very thorough. I'll run over it a few more times for semantic/grammar errors but I'm happy with the layout so far.
