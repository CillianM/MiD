# MiD - My Identity

MiD is an identity engine that will aid in proving a person’s identity. Using a mobile application, it stores information on the user locally and will only be sent out with the user’s permission. This information is verified by respected institutions and the proof of that verification will be stored with a distributed, tamper-resistant solution called the “Blockchain”.
This system aims to tackle the problem of identity fraud, where the need for someone to prove who they are in the modern, social-network driven society is incredibly difficult, as many people leave themselves vulnerable by voluntarily exposing very personal information. By streamlining this process into a safe and secure service will aid in providing not only peace of mind to users but will save companies, and even countries a lot of money in the long run.
Detailed documentation on the development can be found on the [Gitlab blog](https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/mcneilc2/2018-ca400-mcneilc2/blob/master/docs/blog/blog.md) or the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Lp2PAf1i/mid-identity-engine) that I used to create and monitor development tasks.
