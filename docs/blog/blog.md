I decided to get started on work and research regarding my project this week. This would involve initial drafting of my project proposal and researching the various technologies I want to use in my solution. Primarily the research will focus on Hyperledger and the implementations of it currently available. As it's open-source, there will be a lot of varied documentation on it but i'm confident in what's currently there from what I have previously found. My main source of information will come from [their own documentation pages](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

I took the opportunity to meet with two lecturers I thought would help me with my project. Brian Stone was my project supervisor for my third year project. He was extremely helpful last year so I wanted to get his input into my current idea. Geoff Hamilton was my other choice for the project supervisor. He has a background in the field I'm looking at so his experience would be very useful in avoiding some of the common pitfalls.
Over the past few days I have been putting together my project proposal and I intend to send on drafts to both of them and get some feedback.

After some discussion and emails with Geoff Hamilton he has agreed to be my project mentor. I think he'll be very helpful as he has a background in cryptography and security. As my project focuses on this, the help will be invaluable. I finalised everything I wanted in my [project proposal](https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/mcneilc2/2018-ca400-mcneilc2/blob/master/docs/Proposal/Project%20Proposal.pdf). I'll email on the final draft to Geoff and get his thoughts before pushing it to git.
